Objects**\n","\n","This routine automates the extraction of object patches from images by reading YOLO‐style label files, converting their normalized coordinates back into pixel‐level bounding boxes, and verifying that each box lies within the image bounds. Using a thread pool, it concurrently crops the specified regions from the source images, resizes them to a fixed 256×256 resolution, and writes the results to a target directory.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DHbLSxUIY6u8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Cropping and resizing RGB**"],"metadata":{"id":"KwTYdHbwIaXC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def is_valid_bbox(x, y, w, h, img_width=640, img_height=480):\n","    return (\n","        w > 0 and h > 0 and\n","        x >= 0 and y >= 0 and\n","        x + w <= img_width and y + h <= img_height\n","    )\n","\n","def crop_and_resize_image_task(fname, label_dir, image_dir, output_dir):\n","    RESIZED_IMG_WIDTH, RESIZED_IMG_HEIGHT = 256, 256\n","    image_key = fname.replace(\".txt\", \"\")\n","    label_path = os.path.join(label_dir, fname)\n","    image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, f\"{image_key}.png\")\n","    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"{image_key}.png\")\n","\n","    try:\n","        with open(label_path, 'r') as f:\n","            line = f.readline().strip()\n","            if not line:\n","                return (\"skip\", image_key, \"empty label\")\n","\n","            class_id, xc, yc, w, h = map(float, line.split())\n","            x = (xc -
